## SOSA Platform Properties

This building block describes the canonical set of properties for a System object.

These properties are independent of the feature (or object) model implementation 

these properties may be combined with other sets of properties for polymorphic objects - for example a Sensor that has a complex result, but can be broken down into a set of subSystems (a System) or hosted Sensors (a Platform)

Property sets are mix-in aspects that for example may be included in the "properties" component of a GeoJSON object, or used in any other schema.

The "id" property is assumed to be common and compatible with other mix-in aspects.
