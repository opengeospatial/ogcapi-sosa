  "description": "Building Blocks for implementing the core classes of the [Observations and Measurements model]\n\nEach class is implemented using a schema is tied to the equivalent semantic description using the SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) ontology.\n\nAn [aggregate schema](schema.yaml) is provided allowing any of these elements to be combined in a single payload, or each class may be used independently using the relevant schema.\n\nTBD: Convenience API paths may be defined to support traversal of relationships - such as inverse relationships `hasResult`/`isResultOf` , `hasSample`/`isSampleOf` etc. where only one property is present in the data and the inverse is not otherwise accessible.\n",
