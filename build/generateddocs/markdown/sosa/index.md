# Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) (Api)

`ogc.sosa` *v1.0*

The SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) ontology  is a realisation of the Observations, Measurements and Sampling (OMS) Conceptual model

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Description

Building Blocks for implementing the core classes of the [Observations and Measurements model]

Each class is implemented using a schema is tied to the equivalent semantic description using the SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) ontology.

An [aggregate schema](schema.yaml) is provided allowing any of these elements to be combined in a single payload, or each class may be used independently using the relevant schema.

TBD: Convenience API paths may be defined to support traversal of relationships - such as inverse relationships `hasResult`/`isResultOf` , `hasSample`/`isSampleOf` etc. where only one property is present in the data and the inverse is not otherwise accessible.
