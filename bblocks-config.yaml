name: JSON Schemas for OGC/W3C Observations models (SOSA)
abstract: Building blocks for implementation of OGC Observations Measurements and Samples (ISO 19156 aka OMS) using the OGC API Features schema and the OGC/W3C SOSA ontology
description: |
  Each building block defines a reusable JSON schema that is mapped to the equivalent OMS concept.
  
  Each fragment allows for transparent and validatable  use of JSON-LD contexts to map schema elements to equivalent terms from the SOSA ontology. 
  
   _These components are under review by the OMS SWG as candidate canonical implementations._ 
  
   Each building block allows for examples transformed to RDF, which in turn allows for the use of SHACL rules to enforce the semantics of the SOSA and OMS specifications.
