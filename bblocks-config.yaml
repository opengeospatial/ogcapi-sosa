name: Observations (ISO 19156, OGC/W3C SOSA)
abstract: Building blocks for implementation of OGC Observations Measurements and Samples (ISO 19156 aka OMS) using the OGC API Features schema and the OGC/W3C SOSA ontology
description: |
  Each building block defines a reusable JSON schema that is mapped to the equivalent SOSA concept (and transitively mapped to OMS requirements via SOSA).
  
  Each fragment allows for transparent and validatable use of JSON-LD contexts to map schema elements to equivalent terms from the SOSA ontology. 
  
   _These components are under review by the OMS SWG as candidate canonical implementations._ 
  
   Each building block allows for examples transformed to RDF, which in turn allows for the use of SHACL rules to enforce the semantics of the SOSA and OMS specifications.
